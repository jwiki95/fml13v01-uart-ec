## Expansion Card for UART Channel on DC RISC-V Mainboard

This is a KiCad Project with a basic schematic and board layout for connecting to the UART channel 
on the FML13V01 RISC-V Mainboard. This layout is intended to be used with any USB-UART controller
using 0.1 inch pin headers or the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe UART channel using the included JST
cable. This project started with the 
[Expansion Card template](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/ExpansionCards/tree/main/Electrical) 
provided by Framework and the 
[documented pinout](https://github.com/DC-DeepComputing/Framework/blob/main/FML13V01/Framework%20Serial%20Port%20Connection%20Guide.pdf)
from Deep Computing. This design is a work-in-progress as I have not had samples manufactured at this time.
